==========

* librarian w/ yfeldblum DONE
* How to succeed in DevOps without really trying - a chat with Dave Zwieback (@davezwieback), Head of Systems at Knewton.
  The success of DevOps (either in your org, or the movement as a whole) requires, above all, tech generalists. 
  They are rare. How do we find them in an industry (and culture) which mostly values and rewards specialists? 
  How do we build orgs that attract and nurture generalists?
  And, on an individual level, how does one follow the way of the generalist? ;)
