can Chef work on? What does MS need to improve on their side?

package dependencies (.msi, chocolatey)?
* Does using a windows stack add special considerations for
application deployment?
* Do you use ssh keys in windowsland? If not how do your users log on?
* Do you use SSH on your windows machines?
* Do you use Active Directory to access your application servers? Are there strengths or weaknesses in this?
* What is the state of the community around Windows-related cookbooks?
