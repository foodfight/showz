### Introductions

Brought to you by...

#### Why don't you introduce yourselves.


Who are you?  Where are you working?  How can people get in touch with you?

### Windows

* Why does your company use a primarily Windows stack?
* Which versions Windows OS do you run? Win2k8? Win2k8 Server Core?
* Is your company primarily Windows? 
* What tools are typically used to manage Windows environments?
* cygwin, winRM, powershell, what's that lay of the land?
* How well does Chef currently support Windows?
* How receptive are windows admins to automation, esp. since
historically it has been harder to automate Windows, due to being GUI-centric
* How well does Ruby currently support Windows? Do parts of the Stdlib
 like FileUtils and Net::ssh, Net::*, work properly?
* Most *nix folks look down on the Windows Operating
System, perhaps unfairly. What are some good parts of the Windows OS that may
be new and perhaps unknown to *nix people?
* What is winRM?
* Tell us about powershell. Is it as good as or better than the *nix
shells? how well does it integrate with chef? What aout the upcoming
script_resource?
* What aspects of chef on Windows need the most improvement? What part
can Chef work on? What does MS need to improve on their side?
** Which windows apps are the hardest to automate? (Sharepoint?)
** Which apps would benefit the most from automation?
* Bryan: Does MS provide its own configuration Management framework? If not, any idea why it hasn't?
* What has been your experience teaching ruby to windows devs and sysadmins?
* Does Windows have a package manager yet? Or any way to resolve
package dependencies (.msi, chocolatey)?
* Does using a windows stack add special considerations for
application deployment?
* Do you use ssh keys in windowsland? If not how do your users log on?
* Do you use SSH on your windows machines?
* Do you use Active Directory to access your application servers? Are there strengths or weaknesses in this?
* What is the state of the community around Windows-related cookbooks?
* How realistic is it that a given cookbook support both windows and linux? Is it even a good idea?
* What do you have to do to make a cookbook support both windows and linux?
