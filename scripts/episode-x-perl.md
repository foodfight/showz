Outline/Questions
-----------------

David Golden (david at bunchmail.com @xdg) gave a great "Cooking Perl with Chef" talk at OSCON.
"Do you like the idea of repeatable, automated Perl application deployment? Me, too! This talk will show how to make Chef play nice with Perl. You'll learn how to weave together some great tools like perlbrew, local::lib, and carton to isolate your apps and manage them all with Chef."

He is a Perl CPAN maintainer as well, so is versed on community testing. He also announced there is a new "perl-devops" mailing list just launched at perl.org.

Food Fight should get David and another Perl/DevOps hacker or 2 on for a show.
