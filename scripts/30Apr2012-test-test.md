What's Hot!
===========

We have moved foodfightshow's planning documents to github. this means
that you can help us plan shows, submit questions, and otherwise
collaborate.
https://github.com/foodfight/showz

Remember that while the foodfight show format features a panel of
guests on a somewhat general topic, Devops Delicacies are more focused
shows with only a few participants. Also, anyone can record a DevOps
Delicacy as long as you meet our basic standards for audio quality and
content rating. i.e. the only people who get to curse are those that
are as amusing as Artur Bergman or Fujin :)

Also, Chef Hackday on Tuesday, May 15, 13:00 - 21:00 
focus, testing!

What's Cold
===========

Bash, it just doesn't cut it anymore. You can't automate your
infrastructure with Bash or zsh or ksh. Don't kid yourself. Time to
put on your big boy pants and use a full-featured programming language
to automate your infrastructure.
