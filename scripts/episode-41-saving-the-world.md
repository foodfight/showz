  will you be working on at Cycle?
* About Cycle Computing: 
  * what does it do? 
  * what is its goal?
  * how important is automation to Cycle's work?
* Can DevOps tools and processes be used to help combat these global
  issues?
* Can you walk us through a big computation, like a drug discovery
  test? 
  * How is it broken into parts? 
  * How are the code and data distributed to the machines and results
    aggregated?
  * What are the major challenges here? The primary bottlenecks?
* What are the tools to do this kind of HPC work?
  * MPI

  * GridEngine
  * Torque
* How much does HPC overlap w/ Big Data? and will that overlap grow?
  Could Cloudera eventually be your biggest competitor?
* Can the HPC community benefit from the tooling developed by Big Data
  vendors? like the hadoop schedulers or things like
  [Apache Mesos](http://incubator.apache.org/mesos/) or [Cloudera Impala](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products/cloudera-enterprise-core/cloudera-enterprise-RTQ.html)?
