Outline/Questions
-----------------

* Solaris
* SmartOS
* Illumos
* OmniOS
* Does illumos use the BSD userland tools like Mac OS X does or maintain its own userland? put another way, is *BSD the upstream
 for the Solaris userland?
* Why should an application developer care about the platform their code is deployed to?
* How much of a challenge is it to support new hardware, particularly cpus like the Xeon Phi? Do architectures like 
NUMA present special challenges?
* Intel, AMD, and numerous ARM vendors employ tons of linux engineers to add support for their respective processors?
How can Illumos keep up w/ that kind of investment? Can you somehow benefit from or reuse their work?
* Is illumos x86-only? any support yet for ARM?
* If Joyent were to disappear tomorrow, would Illumos be sustainable?
* Do you see Illumos competing w/ linux directly as an application platform or being very successful in defined niches,
such as a hypervisor platform or for storage appliances (Zemanta)?
* What is the advantage of using Illumos as a kvm hypervisor rather than using linux as the hypervisor?
* Imagine introducing Illumos to an experienced linux sysadmin (~5 years of experience) who has never used Solaris. What 
would you tell him to get him excited about Illumos and to actually take the time to learn it?
* what are the biggest stumbling blocks for n00bs who get started w/ Illumos?
* How does [ZFS on Linux](http://zfsonlinux.org/) compare to ZFS on Illumos?
* Are Linux's LXC containers reaching parity w/ Illumos' zones or are they still a long way off? What do they lack?
* What are the greatest challenges, technically and community-wise, for Illumos in the future?
