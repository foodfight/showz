What's Hot!
===========

[Pre-chefconf Hackday in SF](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-DevOps/events/26447591/)

Chef Hackday on Tuesday, May 15, 13:00 - 21:00 
focus, testing!

Public Service Announcement
===========================

Use pry, it will really improve your quality of life. Some tools are
powerful but time-consuming to learn. Pry is powerful and easy. You
can use pry as an interactive debugger for Chef. Can't figure what is
going in your cookbook? Why a resource keeps failing? 

install pry
     $ gem install pry pry-nav pry-doc

Put the following code inside your recipe, upload, and run chef-client

require 'pry'
binding.pry
        
You can thank me later. Not only is pry great for debugging, but it is
awesome for exploring Chef. You can launch pry from within shef

    $ shef -z
    chef> require 'pry'
    chef> binding.pry
    pry> ls node   # view methods on node
    pry> ls Chef::Resource  # view methods on Resource class



Show Outline
============

This episode should cover Etsy's web operations from the ground up,
examining the choices that Etsy has made at every step. This show may
end be split into two episodes if it runs long.
