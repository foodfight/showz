Outline/Questions
-----------------
## Testing defined

A quick definition of the various types of testing:

* syntax and linting
* unit testing
* integration testing
* functional testing
* smoke testing

These are all software development concepts. For Chef, what should go in each type of test? What constitutes a "unit" in Chef for example?

## Testing tools and frameworks available

A quick review of each of the frameworks that are available and in use today:

### Syntax and Linting

* `knife cookbook test`
* foodcritic

### Unit

* chefspec

### Integration

* minitest
* cucumber-chef

### Functional (I think these are all functional?)

* bats
* test-kitchen
* [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/)
* chef-workflow

I feel we should also mention Vagrant since a lot (all?) of these assume familiarity with Vagrant and usage thereof.

## Testing in practice

### Getting started with testing

* What's more important -- unit or integration?
* Best tools for getting started? / which frameworks are you employing
* What testing strategies are in-place in your organization?

### CI, code review, automated testing procedures

* Mandatory gates in place at your org? (check-in control, unit tests, etc.)
* Integrating testing into CI -- are you doing it and if so what are you doing?
* How/do you do code reviews?

### Test structure & discipline
* How do you structure your tests? do u put them in your main cookbook or a sub-ckbk like foo/test/cookbooks/foo_test?
* What are helpers in minitest & rspec?

### "Best Practices"

* How much testing is too much testing?  Is there such a thing?
* Test kitchen drivers - what are they? Which ones are available? What if I want to use driver A on my laptop but driver B in my CI system? How difficult is it to write a new driver?
* What can one use to test a cluster of servers and their interactions?

### Miscellaneous (I'm going to argue "if there's time")

* What is the status of each of these testing tools on Windows?
* What role can chef-zero play in testing?
