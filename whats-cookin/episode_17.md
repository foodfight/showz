## rbenv_system_pkgs Initial Release (a.k.a. the I've-had-it-waiting-for-Ruby-to-compile-all-day-long edition)

The basic idea:

> Installs pre-built rbenv Ruby version tarballs in a system install. It does this by subscribing to an rbenv post-init hook resource in the rbenv cookbook and extracting the tarball packages into the versions/ directory before rbenv tries to build any Ruby versions. With the directory pre-existing a source compile will not be initiated. This cookbook only supports rbenv installed system-wide because the install path is known and likely to not break (since the build target path and extraction path match).

The cookbook's README has instructions that you can follow to build your own system tarball packages. Currently I've only built tarballs for Ubuntu 10.04 through 12.04 on 32 and 64-bit covering some common Ruby versions.

## rvm_passenger v0.8.2

* Fix nginx/passenger module compilation.
* By default, cookbook now finds most current version of passenger gem.
* By default, rvm_ruby is now "#{node['rvm']['default_ruby']}/@passenger".
* Add support for CentOS 5/6.
* Add Travis CI support for Foodcritic
* Refactoring of all recipe code including some code extraction to a Ruby class (thank Foodcritic!)

## rvm v0.9.0 (a.ka. ChefConf edition, released right before I talked to @foodfightshow about RVM/rbenv, oops!)

There are a lot of changes, but here a few:

* Support for several newer RVM features including installing from stable
* Add a new `patch` attribute to rvm_ruby which lets you use patches like the falcon performance patch
* LWRPs can now notify other resources
* Add Travis CI support for Foodcritic
* Add wickedly pretty README site thanks to the DocumentUp project
* Add support Mac OS X Server and Scientific Linux
* Lots of patches and fixes

I'm amazed and thankful to report this release had 9 new committers contributing 11 pull requests of features and fixes.
